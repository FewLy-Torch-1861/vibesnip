# VibeSnip Development Plan

## Goal
Build a privacy-focused, TUI-themed code snippet manager called **VibeSnip**.

## Tech Stack
*   **Backend:** Python (FastAPI) - fast, lightweight, perfect for CLI lovers.
*   **Frontend:** HTML + HTMX - simple, dynamic interactions without heavy JS frameworks.
*   **Styling:** Tailwind CSS (via CDN) - for that crisp, custom "terminal" aesthetic.
*   **Database:** SQLite - local, simple, file-based.

## Features (MVP)
1.  **Dashboard:** List all snippets with a retro terminal look.
2.  **Add Snippet:** Modal or page to paste code, language, and tags.
3.  **Search:** Instant "fuzzy-style" filtering (powered by HTMX).
4.  **Copy:** One-click copy to clipboard.
5.  **Theme:** Dark mode by default (Dracula/Gruvbox style).

## Next Steps
I will initialize the Python environment and start building the backend structure.
